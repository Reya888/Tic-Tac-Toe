# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It can be played in a web browser, where two players take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The game includes features such as a two-player mode, an interactive game board, a reset functionality to start a new game, and visual indications of the winning combination. It is built using HTML for the structure and content of the game, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for game logic and interactivity. To play the game, open the index.html file in a web browser. Player X starts the game by clicking on an empty cell in the grid, and players take turns placing their marks until one player aligns three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win, or until all cells are filled resulting in a draw. You can click the "Reset" button to start a new game. To run this project locally, clone the repository from GitHub, navigate to the project directory, and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser
